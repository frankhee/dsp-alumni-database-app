# DSP Alumni Database V1
### Live site: https://dsp-alumni-database.com

DSP Alumni Database is a single-page, full-stack web application designed to display relevant alumni information from the business fraternity Delta Sigma Pi at the Ohio State University. It uses Node.js with an Airtable database on the backend, and React.js and Redux on the frontend. For security, it uses JWT to authenticate users and bcrypt to encrypt user passwords. For styling, it utilizes Material UI. For deployment, the application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. (__This application is NOT mobile-friendly at the moment, however, it will be in the next version release__).

## Why DSP Alumni Database?

When I came to the United States in 2011, I knew very little English. Throughout my struggles in trying to assimilate and find a community in America, it soon became apparent to me how important building meaningful relationships are for personal growth and success. This is a theme that has resonated throughout my life. In my professional pursuits, this has manifested itself in my deep interest in building authentic relationships between people and promoting inclusion and strengthening ties within my community. DSP Alumni Database's mission is to enable equal access to valuable alumni information for the OSU student community, and to foster an open-source culture among student organizations.
